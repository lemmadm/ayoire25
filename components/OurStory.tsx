We never enter into a formal relationship until late 2023. Damilare is an amazing friend, He LISTENS ALWAYS not just with ears but with Heart and always ready to learn.

But in late 2023, when the relationship started, we spoke our heart and all our conversations felt intentional. We spoke about everything ‚Äî our similarities, differences, purpose, and future dreams. It was not forced. It was like two hearts slowly aligning. Every word drew us closer." },
        { title: "She is Home", author: "Damilare", content: "As we started talking more, it became clear that we shared the same spiritual and life goals. Her depth, her passion for God, and her intentionality made me feel something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time ‚Äî I see my home in her." },
        { title: "I Knew She was the One", author: "Damilare", content: "This is kind of dicey but that a story for another day. I didn‚Äôt want a future without her. I knew she was the one I had been praying for." },
